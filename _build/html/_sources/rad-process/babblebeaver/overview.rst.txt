BabbleBeaver Overview
======================

BabbleBeaver is Buildly's proprietary AI assistant that integrates seamlessly into the RAD process, acting as a collaborative layer rather than just a tool.

What is BabbleBeaver?
=====================

**BabbleBeaver** is an AI-powered team member that:

* **Plans** - Helps decompose work and create realistic timelines
